_Over the years I've rebuilt my website â€” a lot. Through successes and failures
of past sites I've given myself the following guidelines for developing this
blog._

**1. Simple**\
Don't introduce unnecessary features or dependencies. Keep posts
in vanilla Markdown. Remember: the more that is added, the harder it will be to
maintain over time.

**2. DX**\
Optimize for a good developer and writing experience. I won't be compelled to add
content if it becomes tedious.

**3. UX**\
The site must be fast, accessible, and mobile-friendly; there is no reason why all Google
Lighthouse scores shouldn't be 100, or close. 

**4. Short and Sweet**\
Try to set a word limit of ~200 words per post. I have a natural tendency to
write long posts, which often makes it hard to finish them before getting
distracted. 

**5. Fun**\
Give myself permission to have fun with this site: run experiments, restyle, or
even rebuild. _However, this must never come at the cost of other guidelines._
