I rebuild my website â€” a lot. Since learning to code over a decade ago, I've
ripped up my site and made a new one every year or two. As it turns out, even a
simple read-only site offers endless design problems that I've enjoyed teasing
apart. 

At this point I've come at it from virtually every angle: ultra-minimalist
static HTML + CSS, complex sites with dynamic content and animations, and even
using no code solutions like Notion Sites. Predictably, all of these are valid
ways to build a website, all with their own merits and pitfalls. If I've learned
anything, it's that I probably just like building websites. But, there are some
guidelines that I've found useful, that I'll try to enumerate here.

**1. Keep it simple(-ish)**

The more complicated your blog, the harder it is to add new content. I try to
reduce features and dependencies where possible,

**2. Keep it fun**



**3. Keep it short**

I have a natural tendency to write posts that run long. While long posts aren't
inherently bad, I usually lack the time to write them. I'm now optimizing for
more short posts.
