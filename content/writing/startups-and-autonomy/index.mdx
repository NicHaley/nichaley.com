I used to equate startups with autonomy. As someone who generally craves
self-direction and creativity, I built my career around working with early-stage
companies — either as a first or early hire, or as a startup founder myself.

While these jobs afforded me more room to self-govern in a traditional sense,
I've come to learn that startup work comes with its own rules, hierarchies, and
constraints that limit autonomy.

Consider pressures at startups from

**Customers →** product features, pricing\
**VCs and investors →** pushing for growth, product direction, etc\
**Co-founders and other team members →** Internal conflicts\
**Market forces →** Playing to competitors\
**Financial runway →** Being limited by time and money

Ultimately, startups are bound by their need to generate revenue — just like
larger companies. The constraints you avoid at a big company are simply replaced
by different ones.

I still love startups, and have learned to appreciate how these constraints
shape my work. But startups are undoubtedly not the place for boundless
autonomy, creativity and self-expression.

Today, I love to balance startup work with side projects. By fronting my time
with startup work, my side projects are free to be developed without special
consideration for financials, users, markets, or anything else. Projects I
develop this way feel more artful, and truer to my own tastes. It remains to be
seen if the things I make in this way resonant with others, but in some ways it
doesn't matter. The act of creating like this is often its own reward.
