In 2026 I partnered with a couple friends to bring Bagel-O-Clock â€” an art
project where customers could order their own custom 'bagel clocks'. I created the
website, which included a bagel clock builder, checkout, and marketing page.

The project was featured in various publications, including
[BlogTO](https://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2016/01/now_you_can_order_a_custom_bagel_clock_in_toronto/).
