Floe was an open-source AI writing assistant for developers and technical
writers. Floe's core feature, reviews, can be described as an AI-powered linter;
it allowed you to write custom rules in plain language.

I worked on the project from July 2023 to January 2024. In that time I
interviewed around 100 people, built an MVP, and went through the D3 incubator
program.
