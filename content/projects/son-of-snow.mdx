Son of Snow was an interactive poetry site I co-developed with a couple friends.
It featured multiple vignettes where poems were enhanced with audio, video, and
user inputs. For instance, one poem was designed to mimic texting a romantic
partner, while another allowed viewers to read the poem with a 3D representation
of the Sagrada Familia.
