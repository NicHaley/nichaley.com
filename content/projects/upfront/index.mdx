Upfront is a real estate agent finance platform, giving agents early commission
access, health coverage, and more. I joined as the company's first employee,
responsible for building the MVP from the ground up â€” leading product discovery,
designing user and API interfaces, and developing the core underwriting and
advance workflows.
