I started at Ada in 2016 as the company's second hire and first Frontend
Developer. Over my 4 year tenure, I laid the foundation for Ada's dashboard,
chat interface, embed script, iOS SDK, and other products. 

These products have reached 100s of millions of end-users, and are actively used
by companies like Meta, Square, Shopify, Mailchimp, and more.
