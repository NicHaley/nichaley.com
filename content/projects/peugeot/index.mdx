During the early days of the pandemic, I acquired a trashed vintage Peugeot UO-9
"Super Sport". I was looking to learn about bike restoration and maintenance,
and so this bike provided the perfect canvas.

Initially the bike was in pretty rough shape. There was some surface rust, and
the paint was discolored and chipped. Luckily, most of the original components
were still functional.

The first step was to remove the components and clean up the frame. I knew I
wanted to repaint the bike, so I began the annoying task of stripping the
original paint and sanding it. Really I should have just had it sandblasted, but
I felt compelled to do everything myself. This part was by far the most
time consuming.

The bike didn't come with its original wheels, so I purchased a new set with a
wider range. Unfortunately, the new wheels were too wide for the original frame,
so I had to increase the spacing of the dropouts ("cold setting"). I did this by
using a threaded rod with bolts that I used to (very) slowly bend the frame
outwards.

The next challenge I discovered was that the quill stem was frozen, meaning I
couldn't remove the fork from the frame. This also ended up being extremely
difficult to resolve. My first approach was to try applying penetrating oil
daily for a week, but I didn't have any luck. Next, I tried heating the stem
using a blowtorch to try and get it to expand and break the rust, as well as
hammering the top of the stem to try and break the rust free. Again, no luck.

Finally, what ended up working was dissolving the stem (aluminum) in acid (lye
crystals). I had to be super careful with this step to avoid inhaling the fumes
or accidentally getting the acid on my skin.

With the stem removed, I was now free to finish cleaning up the frame. This part
was really satisfying as the polished steel began to shine through. At this
point I also cleaned and polished the original components.

The next step was to paint the bike. I used a spray primer, base coat, and clear
coat to paint it a glossy pebble-white colour. It turned out nicely, but if I
was to do this again I would have it professionally powder coated instead since
the spray paint was very prone to chipping.

The final step was putting the bike back together. This was relatively
straightforward, with the exception of applying the decals which I took care to
position perfectly.

The final result had me pretty jazzed!
