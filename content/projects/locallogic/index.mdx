I worked at LocalLogic between 2021 and 2023 as the company's Lead Frontend
Developer. With Local Logic I was responsible for architecting the rebuild for
the company's flagship location insight SDKs.

The new SDKs are currently in use across major brokerages across North America,
including Realtor.ca, Remax, and more.
