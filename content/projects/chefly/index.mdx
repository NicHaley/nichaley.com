Chefly was a recipe web app I co-developed in 2015. The app allowed users to
find recipes for ingredients they had in the fridge. One of the app highlights
was the simple swipe interface for quickly sifting through recipes; swipe right
to save to your recipe box, or swipe left to continue. We posted the app to
reddit where it made the front page.
