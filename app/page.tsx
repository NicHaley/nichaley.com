      <p>
        I'm a developer and designer based in Montreal [and currently visiting
        X]. I'm currently on paternity leave. Previously, I was a founding
        engineer at Ada and Upfront, and led frontend development at Local
        Logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my work, I explore how design and technology can shape better ways of
        living, especially in our built environment. I also volunteer as a bike
        mechanic and enjoy film and music.
