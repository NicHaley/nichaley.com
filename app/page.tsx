      <p>
        I'm a developer and designer based in Montreal [and currently visiting
        X]. I'm currently on paternity leave. Previously, I was a founding
        engineer at{" "}
        <a href="https://ada.cx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Ada
        </a>{" "}
        and{" "}
        <a href="https://myupfront.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Upfront
        </a>
        , and led frontend development at{" "}
        <a href="https://locallogic.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Local Logic
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        In my work, I explore how design and technology can shape better ways of
        living, especially in our built environment. I also volunteer as a bike
        mechanic and enjoy film and music.
